# Question 1

1.1
### Confidentiality
At the point when we discuss the classification of data, we are looking at shielding the data from being presented to an unapproved party because of an information break or insider danger. Section 44 of the United States Code states that 3542, 'Saving limitations on admittance to your information is significant as it gets your restrictive data and keeps up with your protection'.

You should take significant steps to implement document security, establish security controls for sensitive files, and establish clear information security policies for devices because nobody wants to deal with the consequences of a data breach. Classification covers a range of access controls and measures that shield your data from getting abused by any unapproved access. Implementing safeguards is the best way to protect your data and avoid a data breach.

In today's world, every piece of information a company has is valuable. Whether it's monetary information, charge card numbers, proprietary innovations, or authoritative reports, everything requires legitimate secrecy. To put it another way, sensitive data ought to be accessible only to those individuals who have been granted permission to do so.

An inability to keep up with classification implies that somebody who shouldn't approach has figured out how to gain admittance to private data. Through deliberate way of behaving or unintentionally, a disappointment in privacy can cause some serious pulverization.

The following are some fundamentals of information security to protect your data:
1. Encryption
2. Password
3. Two-factor authentication
4. Biometric verification
[Confidentiality](https://getsmarteye.com/confidentiality-integrity-availability-basics-of-information-security/)

These are the information security big A's:
- Authentication, which refers to the procedures that enable systems to ascertain whether a user is who they claim to be. These incorporate passwords and the array of procedures accessible for laying out personality: cryptographic keys, biometrics, security tokens, and other similar items.

- Authorization, which figures out who has the privilege to get to which information: Even though a system knows who you are, it doesn't always make all of its data available to you! One of the main ways of authorizing privacy is laying out have to-know instruments for information access; like that, clients whose records have been hacked or who have denounced any kind of authority can't think twice about information. Most working frameworks implement classification in this sense by having many records just open by their makers or an administrator, for example.
[examples](https://www.csoonline.com/article/568917/the-cia-triad-definition-components-and-examples.html)

### Integrity
Data must be kept consistent, accurate, and trustworthy throughout its entire lifecycle. Information should not be changed on the way, and steps should be taken to guarantee it can't be adjusted by unapproved individuals - - for instance, in information breaks.

Measures connected with information uprightness incorporate record authorizations and client access controls. When an authorized user accidentally makes a change or deletes something, version control is used to fix it. Most of the time, organizations have some way of detecting data changes caused by things other than people, like an electromagnetic pulse or a server crash.

Information could incorporate checksums, even cryptographic checksums, for confirmation of honesty. In order to bring the affected data back to its original state, backups or redundant storage must be available. Moreover, advanced marks can be utilized to give powerful nonrepudiation measures, importance proof of logins, messages sent, and electronic record review and sending can't be denied.
[integrity](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Confidentiality-integrity-and-availability-CIA)

When data is transmitted between systems and/or stored on systems, such as email, an example of integrity in cyber security could be present. As a result, the majority of current enterprise security solutions make data integrity maintenance a crucial component.

Keeping up with honesty isn't simply critical to control access at a framework level, yet additionally to guarantee that clients can change data that they are approved to modify. Integrity in cyber security is the most important step in ensuring that your organization safeguards its assets when evaluating the best ways to safeguard sensitive data. 

Because it outlines three primary objectives that cybersecurity teams should adhere to, data integrity is extremely important in the field of cybersecurity.

- Keeping unapproved clients from making adjustments to projects or information.
- Keeping approved clients from making unapproved or ill-advised changes.
- Keeping up with both the inward and outside consistency of projects and information.

### Availability
Accessibility is one of the three essential elements of safety the executives that are available in all frameworks. Accessibility is the statement that a PC framework is accessible or open by an approved client at whatever point it is required. The high order of availability of a system ensures that it will function as expected when needed. Accessibility gives working of adaptation to non-critical failure framework in the items. It additionally guarantees the reinforcement handling by remembering hot and cold locales for the debacle recuperation arranging.

Data should be accessible when it is required. In order to guarantee a high level of data availability, you need to keep your software and hardware running smoothly and provide enough bandwidth. However, these actions alone are insufficient in light of the fact that there are outer powers affecting everything; The availability of data can also be harmed by:

- Denial of Service (DoS) determines to activities that lock up figuring administrations such that the approved clients can't utilize the framework at whatever point required. Additionally, access is restricted to authorized users for a time period if a security office accidentally locks up an access control to a database during routine system maintenance. As an illustration of denial of service, the internet worm overloaded approximately 10% of the computer systems on the network, rendering them unresponsive to user requests.
- Loss of Data Processing Capabilities: The deficiency of information handling abilities are for the most part brought about by the catastrophic events or human activities is maybe more normal. Possibility arranging is the action to counter such kind of misfortunes, which helps in limiting the ideal opportunity for that an information handling capacity stays inaccessible. Possibility arranging gives an elective method for handling which includes business resumption arranging, elective site handling or basically fiasco recuperation arranging in this way guarantees information accessibility.
[Availability](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/availability-in-information-security/)

The following are measures taken to reduce availability threats:

- Off-site reinforcements
- Debacle recuperation
- Overt repetitiveness
- Failover
- Strike
- High-accessibility bunches

#### Keep passwords in a safe place offline
There are various ways you can store passwords to assist you with recalling that them, be it on the web or disconnected. The best way to store passwords offline is on paper if you want to keep them out of an online environment. Try to not think of them precisely in exactly the same words; provide yourself a clue or insight into help you.

For instance, say your secret phrase incorporates the telephone number of a close buddy of yours from back when it was ordinary to retain home telephone numbers. You could say something like "B's number" for your clue. This ought to incite you to recall it, while being for all intents and purposes unthinkable for any other individual to figure.

#### Set up secure passwords
Having a powerless secret phrase is a certain fire method for turning into a casualty of misrepresentation. A frail one can be handily speculated, so beginning solid with a solid secret word for everything is an unquestionable requirement.

On the off chance that you're truly stuck, you could utilize a secret key generator to haphazardly choose a safe secret phrase that will not get neglected. In any case, some go-to ways to set up secure passwords include:

- Ensuring the secret key is at least 12 characters in length
- Counting accentuation marks all through
- Counting capitalized and lower-case letters all through
- Not involving numbers in return for letters for example 9 rather than g
-  Keeping away from essential console ways, as 123456 or qwerty

1.3
#### Radius
RADIUS represents Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service. It is a network protocol that gives users of network services a lot of centralized Authentication, Accounting, and Authorization. When a user requests access to network resources, the RADIUS server encrypts the user's credentials and begins the protocol's operation. After this, the accreditations are planned through the neighborhood information base, after this, assuming all checks are valid client is conceded admittance.

The network access management protocol known as RADIUS is an access control protocol. It utilizes a verification server to check the character of clients and approve admittance to arrange assets. Sweep utilizes symmetric encryption to safeguard client qualifications during transmission. RADIUS is used to control who can access network resources because it is used for network access control.

As far as adaptability, Range is profoundly versatile and can be utilized to oversee enormous organizations.

**Features of RADIUS :**

- Its server can acts as a proxy client to other Radius Servers.
- Communication between client and server authenticated by a shared key
- It supports PPP, PAP, and CHAP protocols for authentication purposes.
- It runs using UDP and is a stateless protocol.
[RADIUS vs Kerberos](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-kerberos-and-radius/)

### Benefits of RADIUS

#### Logging and Auditing
RADIUS gives logging and reviewing highlights. This implies that you can follow who is getting to your framework and when. Furthermore, you can utilize these logs to recognize any dubious action. The fact that RADIUS can be used to meet compliance requirements is one of its many advantages. Businesses like medical care and fund frequently have severe consistence prerequisites. You can quickly meet these requirements with RADIUS' assistance.

#### Helps prevent DoS attacks
The increasingly prevalent "Denial of Service" (DoS) attacks can be aided by RADIUS. DoS assaults are a sort of assault where the assailant attempts to make a framework inaccessible by flooding it with demands. Sweep can assist with forestalling these kinds of assaults by rate restricting the quantity of solicitations every client can make. An attacker will find it much more difficult to disable a system as a result of this.

### Unique Credentials for each user
With Sweep, every client has their own novel qualifications. This means that the credentials of other users won't be affected if one user's credentials are stolen. This also makes it harder for someone to get into your system without your permission. RADIUS is excellent for remote businesses and those with remote employees for these reasons.
[benefits for RADIUS](https://www.motocms.com/blog/en/benefits-of-radius-based-authentication/)

#### Kerberos
Kerberos is a convention that aids network validation. This is utilized for approving clients/servers in an organization utilizing a cryptographic key. It is intended for serious areas of strength for executing while at the same time imparting to applications. MIT's implementation of the Kerberos protocol is utilized in numerous mass-produced goods and is freely available.

Kerberos is a ticket-based authentication protocol for accessing network resources. By employing both symmetric and asymmetric encryption, it provides high security. Kerberos upholds single sign-on, which permits clients to get to different assets without the need to reemerge their qualifications. Kerberos is intended for network confirmation, and that implies it is utilized to check the character of clients getting to arrange assets.

Kerberos may not be suitable for large networks due to its limited scalability.

**Features of Kerberos :**

- It prevents a variety of intrusion attempts.
- It makes Web app authentication work across the internet.
- Gives remarkable trust at the root and lessens full cross section situations.
- Permits communication with other passage domains.
[Kerberos](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Kerberos)

### Benefits of Kerberos Authentication
There are a few vital benefits to involving Kerberos as a validation administration.
#### Access Control
The Kerberos verification convention empowers powerful access control. Clients benefit from a solitary point for monitoring all logins and the implementation of safety strategies. 
#### Mutual Authentication
Kerberos verification permits administration frameworks and clients to confirm one another. Both the client and the server will be aware that the counterparts with whom they are interacting are genuine at any point in the process.
#### Limited Ticket Lifetime
Each ticket in Kerberos has timestamps and lifetime information, and the length of confirmation is constrained by administrators. 
#### Reusable Authentication
Kerberos verification is tough and reusable. Every client will just must be checked by the framework once. Then all through the lifetime of the ticket, the client can verify without the need to reemerge individual data. 
#### Security
Numerous mystery keys, outsider approval, and cryptography make Kerberos a protected confirmation convention. Passwords are not sent over the organizations, and mystery keys are encoded, making it challenging for aggressors to imitate clients or administrations.

# Question 2

2.1
### Interception
When two connected entities exchange a message over the Internet, data communication typically takes place:

On account of a capture assault, a pernicious entertainer can get to private or classified data with no real approval. One common type of attack in this category is eavesdropping. In particular, a gatecrasher can allude to a few procedures, for example, bundle sniffing and man-in-the-middle (MITM).

They usually try to disrupt data exchanges on the network or get important information like credit card numbers and passwords. When really executed, recognizing hints of the attack can be exceptionally hard:

Data confidentiality poses the primary threat in this category of attacks. By encrypting our communications, avoiding unreliable Wi-Fi networks, and regularly updating our software, we can reduce its impact.
[Interception](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/security-interruption-interception-modification-fabrication)

Examples of Interception attacks:

- Eavesdropping on communication. Eavesdropping is the demonstration of secretly tuning in on confidential discussions or checking information transmissions without the information on the gatherings in question.
- Man In The Middle (MITM).  Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are a particularly sneaky type of interception in which the attacker puts themselves in the middle of two parties' conversations by intercepting their communications. In doing as such, the aggressor can snoop on, control, or even mimic either party without their insight.
- Illicit copying of files or programs.
- Obtaining copies of messages for later replay.
- Packet sniffing and key logging to capture data from a computer system or network. Packet sniffing is a method utilized by assailants to catch and break down network traffic, permitting them to capture delicate information as it's sent over the organization. Packet sniffers can be utilized to screen all information going through an organization, including decoded data and, at times, even scrambled information on the off chance that the aggressor can unscramble it.
[Examples](https://privacypursuits.com/internet-security/demystifying-interception-in-cyber-security-an-essential-guide/)

#### Layer 2 attacks

Within the same local area network, the data frame transfer between two directly connected nodes is the responsibility of the data link layer. Frames are created from the physical layer's raw bits. It could likewise perform mistake checking and amendment.

The information connect layer is where pernicious entertainers can start to exploit the edge, a snippet of data that is essential for the transmission on this piece of the OSI layers. Each casing has a header, body and trailer. In the event that assailants can see or control these casings, then, at that point, they can think twice about information. This layer can likewise experience the ill effects of over-burden, debasing execution. MAC address spoofing, MAC address flooding, virtual local area network (LAN) circumvention, and address resolution protocol poisoning are the kinds of attacks you should be concerned about here.
[Layer 2 data link](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/osi-layers-data-link-layer/)

Examples of Layer 2 attacks
- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Attacks. On LAN-switched networks, the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is utilized. Its essential capability is eliminating possible circles inside the organization. Layer 2 LANs would simply cease to function without STP because the network's loops would flood the switches with traffic. The upgraded activity and design of STP guarantees that the LAN stays steady and that traffic follows the most streamlined way through the organization. This attack has the potential to significantly impact the usability and security of the traffic flowing through the network if an attacker inserts a new STP device onto the network and attempts to alter STP's operation.
- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Attacks. Every network device that connects to an Ethernet network uses the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). Gadgets use ARP to find the Layer 2 Ethernet address (Macintosh) for an objective gadget, utilizing just the objective gadget's realized IP address. Because devices are told to trust the answers they receive, ARP itself is inherently insecure. Therefore, if device C replies in place of device B to a request for the MAC address of device B, device A will forward all traffic destined for device B to device C. If device C was attempting a transparent attack, it would record the data from the traffic while forwarding the traffic to device B; A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is the term for this.
- Media Access Control (MAC) Spoofing. A Media Access Control (MAC) spoofing attack occurs when one network device uses another's MAC address. The objective of the assailant is to divert all of the traffic for the designated gadget to the going after gadget. In the event that you contemplate a phone organization, this assault is what could be compared to somebody assuming control over your telephone number and having future calls rerouted to them. This rerouting could be utilized to mask one gadget as one more for various purposes, including to go about as that gadget (potentially a server), or to play out a disavowal of-administration assault on that gadget.

2.2
**Access Control Lists** (ACLs) are a security feature used to define and manage permissions within a computer network or system. The main use of ACLs is to control access to resources, such as files, directories, or network services, by specifying which users or system processes are granted access and what operations are allowed on given resources.

In the context of securing a student record system in a tertiary college, ACLs can be implemented to regulate access to sensitive student information. For example, you could define ACL rules that restrict access to student records based on user roles. Faculty members may be granted read-only access to view student grades, while administrative staff might have full access to update and maintain records. At the same time, students themselves may be given access only to their own records.

Here's a simplified example of how ACLs could be used to secure a student record system:

1. **Define Roles:**
    - Create roles such as "Faculty," "Administrator," and "Student."
2. **Create ACL Rules:**
    - Grant "Read" access to the "Faculty" role for viewing student records.
    - Grant "Read/Write" access to the "Administrator" role for updating and managing records.
    - Grant "Read" access to the "Student" role for viewing their own records.
3. **Apply ACLs:**
    - Implement ACLs on the database or file system housing the student records.

By implementing ACLs in this manner, you ensure that access to student records is controlled based on predefined roles, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or tampering with sensitive information.

**Network Access Control** (NAC) is a security solution designed to regulate and manage access to a network based on the endpoint's compliance with security policies. The primary use of NAC is to ensure that only authorized and secure devices can connect to the network, preventing unauthorized access, potential threats, and ensuring compliance with security standards.

In the context of securing a student record system in a tertiary college, NAC can be implemented to control access to the network that hosts the system. Here's an example of how NAC could be used:

1. **Define Security Policies:**
   - Establish security policies that specify the requirements for devices to connect to the network. This may include having updated antivirus software, the latest security patches, and specific configurations.

2. **Deploy NAC Solution:**
   - Implement a NAC solution at the network entry points, such as switches or wireless access points, to enforce the security policies.

3. **Pre-Connection Health Checks:**
   - Before allowing a device to connect to the network, the NAC solution performs health checks to verify compliance with the security policies. For instance, it may check for the presence of antivirus software and the latest operating system updates.

4. **Quarantine Non-Compliant Devices:**
   - If a device fails the health check, the NAC solution can place it in a quarantine network or deny access until the necessary security measures are in place.

5. **Authorize Access for Authorized Devices:**
   - Only devices that meet the security criteria are granted full access to the network, including the server hosting the student record system.

By using NAC in this manner, the college can ensure that only secure and compliant devices have access to the network, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or the introduction of malware.

**Data Loss Prevention** (DLP) is a comprehensive set of tools, processes, and policies designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, and transmission of sensitive data, aiming to protect valuable information from being disclosed, altered, or deleted. The main use of DLP is to safeguard sensitive data and intellectual property, ensuring that it is not inadvertently or maliciously leaked or lost.

In the context of securing a student record system in a tertiary college, DLP can be employed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive student information. Here's an example of how DLP could be used:

1. **Identify Sensitive Data:**
   - Classify sensitive data within the student record system, such as personal information, grades, and other confidential records.

2. **Define DLP Policies:**
   - Establish DLP policies specifying rules and conditions for handling sensitive data. For example, policies may prohibit the transmission of student records via unencrypted email or restrict access to certain user roles.

3. **Monitoring and Enforcement:**
   - Implement DLP solutions that monitor data in real-time. These solutions can inspect outgoing network traffic, emails, or file transfers to identify and prevent the unauthorized sharing of sensitive data.

4. **Encryption and Masking:**
   - Utilize DLP technologies to enforce encryption for sensitive data in transit and implement masking techniques to protect data at rest. This adds an additional layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.

5. **Incident Response:**
   - Configure DLP systems to generate alerts or take automated actions in response to policy violations. This could include blocking the transmission of sensitive data or notifying security personnel.

By implementing DLP measures, the college can proactively mitigate the risk of data breaches, accidental disclosures, or unauthorized access to student records, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information.

2.4
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) employ various methodologies for monitoring and identifying potential security threats or attacks. Two prominent types of methodologies are Signature-Based Detection and Anomaly-Based Detection.

1. **Signature-Based Detection:**
   - **Methodology:** Signature-based detection relies on predefined patterns, known as signatures, that represent specific characteristics of known attacks. These signatures are derived from the analysis of past attacks and are stored in a signature database. The IDS compares network traffic or system activity against these signatures. If a match is found, the system identifies and alerts on the known attack.

   - **Example:** Snort is a widely used open-source IDS that utilizes signature-based detection. Snort analyzes network traffic in real-time and compares it to a database of predefined rules or signatures. For instance, a signature may represent a common network attack pattern, such as a specific sequence of packets indicative of a known malware or a denial-of-service attack.

2. **Anomaly-Based Detection:**
   - **Methodology:** Anomaly-based detection focuses on establishing a baseline of normal behavior for a system or network and then identifying deviations from this baseline. The system monitors for unusual or anomalous patterns, behaviors, or activities that may indicate a security threat. Anomalies are often detected through statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms that learn and adapt to changes in the environment.

   - **Example:** One example of anomaly-based detection is the use of machine learning algorithms in an IDS. These algorithms learn the typical patterns of network traffic, system usage, or user behavior. If the system observes deviations from the learned normal behavior, it triggers an alert. For instance, if a user suddenly attempts to access a large number of files in a short period, the anomaly-based IDS may flag this as potentially malicious behavior.

# Question 3

3.1
Symmetric and asymmetric encryption represent two fundamental approaches to securing digital communication, each with its unique characteristics and applications. Let's delve into a detailed discussion to explore the differences, focusing on the use of keys, state, and the motivation behind choosing one method over the other.  
  
**1. Symmetric Encryption:**  
  - **Key Usage:** Symmetric encryption relies on a single shared key for both encryption and decryption. This shared key must be securely exchanged between the parties involved. For example, if Alice wants to send an encrypted message to Bob, both Alice and Bob need to possess and safeguard the same secret key.  
  - **State:** Symmetric encryption is more efficient for large data sets as it operates with a single key. However, the challenge lies in securely distributing this shared key, as interception during transmission could compromise the security of the communication.  
  
**2. Asymmetric Encryption:**  
  - **Key Usage:** Asymmetric encryption employs a pair of keys - a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key can be freely shared, but the private key must remain confidential. When Alice wants to send a secure message to Bob, she uses Bob's public key to encrypt it, and only Bob, with his private key, can decrypt the message.  
  - **State:** Asymmetric encryption is often used for secure key exchange during the initial setup of communication. Its advantage lies in eliminating the need for a pre-existing relationship between parties, making it suitable for secure communication initiation.  
  
**Motivation for Increased Security and Protection:**  
  - **Symmetric Encryption:** Despite its challenges in key distribution, symmetric encryption is faster and more efficient for bulk data encryption once the keys are securely shared. It becomes a preferred choice for continuous data transmission after the initial setup.  
  - **Asymmetric Encryption:** The strength of asymmetric encryption lies in its ability to securely exchange keys without a shared secret beforehand. This makes it ideal for scenarios where parties don't have a prior relationship or need to establish a secure channel before employing symmetric encryption.  
  
**Balancing Security and Efficiency:**  
  - **Hybrid Approach:** Combining both symmetric and asymmetric encryption in a hybrid approach is a common strategy. The initial key exchange and setup can leverage asymmetric encryption for its security benefits, while symmetric encryption can then be employed for the efficient transmission of large amounts of data.  
  
In conclusion, the choice between symmetric and asymmetric encryption hinges on the specific security requirements of a given communication scenario. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each method, security professionals can devise a comprehensive strategy that maximizes both security and efficiency in the realm of digital communication.

3.2
**A. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL):**  
  - **Example in Finance:** Visualize online banking as your digital fortress, and when you log in to inspect your account, SSL acts as a guardian angel. It's like a discreet security detail ensuring that your confidential exchanges with the bank remain private. SSL creates an invisible shield around your financial data, preventing any digital snoopers from eavesdropping on your transactions or gaining access to sensitive information.  
  
**B. Hypertext Transport Protocol Secure (HTTPS):**  
  - **Example in Business:** Imagine online shopping as a vibrant marketplace, and when you click "Buy Now" on that irresistible item, HTTPS serves as a trusted courier. It's the digital equivalent of a secure transaction, ensuring that your payment details are delivered safely to the seller. HTTPS acts like a diligent messenger, guarding your credit card information against any potential online pickpockets and making your digital shopping experience both seamless and secure.  
  
**C. Secure Shell (SSH):**  
  - **Example in Business:** Consider SSH as your corporate teleportation device. When your IT expert needs to magically transport themselves to the company servers from a remote location, SSH acts like an exclusive access code. It's the digital key to the server room, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access and manage sensitive business data. SSH becomes the enabler of secure remote connections, allowing your IT team to maintain and troubleshoot without compromising the integrity of your company's digital assets.  
  
**D. Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP):**  
  - **Example in Finance:** Envision a virtual meeting room where financial strategies are discussed in real-time. SRTP plays the role of a vigilant bodyguard for your video and audio conversations. It ensures that the details of your financial discussions stay within the confines of the virtual conference space, protected against any digital eavesdroppers. SRTP becomes the digital bouncer, securing the confidentiality of your financial deliberations during virtual meetings and preventing any unauthorized access.  
  
**E. IP Security (IPsec):**  
  - **Example in Business:** Picture a multinational corporation with offices scattered worldwide. IPsec emerges as the superhero cape for your inter-office communication.
