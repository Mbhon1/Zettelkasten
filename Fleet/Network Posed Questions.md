1. Configuration Manager, commonly known as SCCM, is a powerful and versatile tool created by Microsoft. It provides IT professionals with an integrated platform to manage and deploy software, hardware, and other resources across their networks.
2. SCCM, is a tool developed by Microsoft that is used to manage and deploy software, hardware, and other resources across an organization’s network. It is part of the Microsoft System Center suite of products, and is a powerful and versatile tool that allows IT professionals to streamline their operations and increase efficiency.
3. It allows IT professionals to remotely install, update, and manage software, hardware, and other resources across their networks. It also provides tools for monitoring and reporting on the health and performance of their networks. Additionally, it can be used to deploy operating systems, applications, and patches on a large scale, and to manage the security and compliance of the network.
## Components of SCCM

- **Console**, which is used to manage and configure the system; 
- **Site server**, which stores configuration data and provides access to the SCCM console;
- **Client**, which runs on each managed device; 
- **Database**, which stores information about the managed resources; 
- **Distribution points**, which are used to deploy applications and patches; 
- **Management points**, which provide access to the SCCM console; 
- **Reporting services**, which generate reports about the managed resources.

# Define Windows Deployment Services

1. Windows Deployment Services (WDS) enables you to deploy Windows operating systems over the network, which means that you do not have to install each operating system directly from a CD or DVD.

## Benefits WDS

- Allows network-based installation of Windows operating systems, which reduces the complexity and cost when compared to manual installations.
- Supports deploying images for mixed environments including Windows 7and Windows Server 2008 R2 through Windows 8.1and Windows Server 2012 R2.
- Uses standard Windows Setup technologies including Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE), .wim files, and image-based setup.
- Transmits data and images by using multicast functionality.
- Allows you to create images of a reference computer using the Image Capture Wizard, which is an alternative to the ImageX tool.
- Allows you to add driver packages to the server and configure them to be deployed to client computers along with the install image.

# What is Default Gateway?

A default gateway makes it possible for devices in one [network](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-computer-networking-816249) to communicate with devices in another network. If a computer, for example, requests a web page, the request goes through the default gateway before exiting the [local network (LAN)](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-lan-4684071) to reach the internet.

Think of a default gateway as an intermediate device between the local network and the internet. The default gateway transfers internal data to the internet and back again.
